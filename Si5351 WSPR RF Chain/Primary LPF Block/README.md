# Primary Low-Pass Filter (≤ 28 MHz)

## Overview

This block implements a **fixed broadband low-pass filter** with a cutoff just above 28 MHz.
It is intended to remove harmonic and edge-related spectral content generated by the Si5351
and preserved through upstream buffering and attenuation.

The filter provides:

- Strong attenuation of harmonics above the HF band
- Minimal insertion loss across 160 m through 10 m
- A well-defined spectral boundary before broadband gain stages

Measured and simulated insertion loss is **< 0.5 dB at 28 MHz** when implemented with suitable components.

## Intent and Design Goals

Digital clock-based RF generation produces broadband harmonic content that must be removed
before amplification.

This primary LPF is designed to:

- Define a clear upper spectral boundary at the HF band edge
- Reduce the burden on downstream band-pass filtering
- Prevent broadband MMIC stages from amplifying out-of-band energy
- Operate without tuning or adjustment

The filter is intentionally **fixed and conservative**, favoring spectral cleanliness
over sharp cutoff characteristics.

## Circuit Description

The filter is a **7-pole low-pass LC network** optimized for a 50 ohm system impedance.

Topology:

- Series inductors at the input, output, and intermediate nodes
- Shunt capacitors to ground between inductive sections

The design is symmetric to maintain consistent impedance behavior
across the passband.

## Component Selection Rationale

### Inductors

- **L1, L4 = 313 nH**
- **L2, L3 = 556 nH**

Recommended characteristics:

- 0805 wirewound inductors
- Self-resonant frequency ≥ 150–200 MHz
- High Q at approximately 30 MHz

Inductor SRF and Q directly affect insertion loss and stopband attenuation.

### Capacitors

- **C1, C3 = 151 pF**
- **C2 = 167 pF**

Recommended characteristics:

- 0603 NP0/C0G dielectric
- 50 V rating if convenient

NP0/C0G capacitors ensure stability and minimal loss across temperature
and frequency.

## Performance Expectations

### Electrical Behavior

- Passband: DC through approximately 28 MHz
- Insertion loss: < 0.5 dB at 28 MHz
- System impedance: 50 ohm

### Spectral Behavior

The filter provides:

- Significant attenuation of the 2nd harmonic and higher
- Reduction of broadband edge energy
- Cleaner input spectrum to the MMIC gain block

This stage is the primary barrier preventing out-of-band energy
from being amplified downstream.

## Integration Notes

### Placement in Signal Chain

Recommended placement:

```text
Si5351
    → RF Isolation & Edge Conditioning Buffer
    → Fixed Attenuation Pad
    → Primary Low-Pass Filter
    → Broadband MMIC Gain Block
    → Band-Specific Band-Pass Filter / PA
```

### Operating Assumptions

- The filter is driven from a **50 ohm source**.
- Output is terminated into a **50 ohm load**.
- Additional band-specific filtering may follow this stage.

This LPF is not intended to replace band-pass filters on individual bands,
but to reduce broadband content ahead of gain.

---

## Layout Guidelines

- Keep all LC elements tightly clustered.
- Minimize loop area in shunt capacitor ground returns.
- Use **at least two ground vias per shunt capacitor**.
- Avoid long stubs at the filter input and output.

Layout quality strongly influences achievable stopband attenuation.

---

## Testing and Validation

Recommended checks:

- Measure insertion loss across the HF bands.
- Verify harmonic attenuation at ≥ 2× fundamental frequency.
- Confirm no unexpected passband ripple due to layout issues.

No tuning is required during normal operation.

## Summary

This primary low-pass filter provides a fixed, broadband spectral boundary at the top of the HF band.
It significantly reduces harmonic and edge-related energy before amplification and improves
overall system spectral cleanliness.
